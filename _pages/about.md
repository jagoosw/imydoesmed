# Who am I? 
I am third year medical student at University of Cambridge and a proud advocate for widening participation. 

Coming from a low income family and a northern state comprehensive, I found it really difficult to gain an insight into medicine and universities in general. Admissions are not and will never be a level playing field, but I am dedicated to improving this in any way I can. I have previously served terms as JCR Access Officer and on the CamWAMS committee, as well as providing free tutoring and admissions mentoring, and I am now building a social media presence in the widening participation space to reach more students. 

Outside of access, I am a keen mental health advocate and have recently been appointed as a trustee of YoungMinds! I am also interested in oncology, specifically molecular oncology. In my third year I will be majoring in pharmacology as part of the BBS course. 

(When I'm not revising) I also enjoy good food, travelling and watching Netflix.

# Why start a blog?
I started my 'medgram' in July 2020 to share my journey and support prospective medical students. Within 3 weeks I have gained almost 900 followers, participated in an IGTV Live Q&A with over 1500 views and received a great deal of positive feedback. I would like to expand on this success through my blog, removing the caption length constraints and providing more in depth, informative content. My aim is to provide quality, useful content that is accessible to all.
